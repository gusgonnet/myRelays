# myRelays project
Control your relays from everywhere

## Boards tested

These are the boards tested:

* a [Particle Argon](https://store.particle.io/products/argon) plus an [Adafruit Power Relay FeatherWing](https://store.particle.io/products/adafruit-power-relay)

* a [simple relay](https://wiki.wemos.cc/products:d1_mini_shields:relay_shield) connected to a [Particle Photon](https://store.particle.io/products/photon)

* a [4 relays NCD board](https://store.ncd.io/product/4-channel-general-purpose-spdt-relay-shield-4-gpio-with-iot-interface/)

* a [Particle relay shield](https://store.particle.io/products/relay-shield) with a Photon or Argon

## Boards supported

**Theoretically**, there is a large number of boards one can use with this project:

* any [Particle Mesh device](https://store.particle.io/collections/mesh) coupled with an Adafruit Power Relay FeatherWing may run this firmware.

* a [Particle relay shield](https://store.particle.io/products/relay-shield) with an Electron

* any [3v3 relay](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=3v+relay+arduino&_trksid=m194) and a Photon, [Bluz](https://bluz.io/) or even a [RedBear Duo](https://store.particle.io/products/redbear-duo)

* NCD boards with 1 or [up to 24 relays!](https://store.ncd.io/product/24-channel-general-purpose-spdt-relay-shield-8-gpio-with-iot-interface/)
